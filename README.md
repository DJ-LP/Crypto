# Secure Cryptography Tool 

## Description This project is a secure cryptography tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text as well as hide and read text directly in images. 

## Features: - **Text Encryption**: Uses modern encryption technology from `cryptography.fernet`. 
- **Text Decryption**: Decrypts texts using the previously generated or loaded key. 
- **Hide text in image**: Uses steganography to hide text in images.
- **Extract Text from Image**: Extracts hidden text from images. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` 
- `Pillow`
- `pytesseract` (for image extraction) 

### Installation To install the project locally, perform the following steps: 1. Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/DJ-LP/Crypto.git
